\section{Development and results}
\label{sec:dev}
Using the gained knowledge about some of the most frequent persistence techniques, explained in section \ref{sec:research} - \textit{Research}, a tool has been created to automate several of them, facilitating their deployment.

This chapter contains a description of how the tool was developed, starting from its design, followed by its implementation in each operating system, and ending with an analysis of the obtained results.
