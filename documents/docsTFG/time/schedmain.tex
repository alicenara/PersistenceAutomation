\section{Scheduling}
\label{sec:sched}
To achieve all the goals described in sections \ref{ssec:objectives} and \ref{ssec:scope} this project has been divided into some tasks, both to ease the calculation of the time each part take, and also be able to consider some extra time for the obstacles that can come across (as described in section \ref{ssec:obstacles}). 

This section contains information about the project's organization and temporal planning: which are its main tasks, what resources (like materials or time) will be needed in each task, and how resources and tasks are related. All this scheduling is graphically shown in the Gantt chart in section \ref{ssec:gantt}, where it is possible to get an overview of all the different stages.

This TFG was started on July 14, 2021, and its defense is on January 24, 2022, even though the deadline to deliver the final project is on January 17, 2022.
