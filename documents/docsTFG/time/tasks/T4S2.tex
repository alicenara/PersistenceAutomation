\textbf{Explanation}

This subtask had three different important parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Design the basic structure of the script, organized to include a section to read the configuration file, another to deploy different techniques, and finally a function to apply the logic of the automation. The design needed to focus on the automation of the chosen persistence techniques, but the script required to adapt to the needs of its users too and also to be easily adjustable to each operating system.

This part was really necessary since it defined the structure of the final scripts, allowing the other coding subtasks to be completed faster and consistently.


\item Determine which techniques were going to be coded in the final project, as not all of them could be automated. Also, there were two types of techniques: discovery ones, used to analyze the host system, and persistence ones, which are the ones to be deployed.



\item Create a base script that implemented the design, with some function names and a description of the main function's logic.
\end{enumerate}


%The main goal is to be able to launch different types of persistence depending on the recovered characteristics of the computer.
%
%%The techniques implemented on this part are listed in section \ref{ssec:development-base}
%This script will collect different types of information, like:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Computer specifications.
%\item Internet connectivity status.
%\item User privileges.
%\end{itemize}

The total duration of this subtask was \the\value{tQuatreDosHours} hours, spent in a week and a half, and a few hours were used to add to the documentation how this process was developed and also some information about the final design.
