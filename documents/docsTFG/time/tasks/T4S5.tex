\textbf{Explanation}\\
Similar to the previous subtask, the main goal of this one was to build a script in PowerShell both to collect environmental information and to deploy persistence using different techniques.
%, depending on the results of previous subtasks.

This script followed the design created in section T4S2 and was fully tested to end up with the finished script for Windows.

%The techniques implemented on this part are listed in section \ref{ssec:development-windows}
The techniques implemented on this part were:
\begin{itemize}
\item Startup folders 
\item Registry 
\item Scheduled tasks
\item Services
\item Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
\item BITS Jobs
\item RDP backdoor
\item External backdoor deployment
\end{itemize}

This task took three weeks, spending 1/3 of the time testing and documenting the process.
