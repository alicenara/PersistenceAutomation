\textbf{Explanation}\\
The main goal of this subtask was to study how persistence techniques can be applied and which discovery techniques were interesting to add, to be able to better automate the deployment of the persistence techniques and build some of the program's main features: collect information about the computer and deploy persistence.

To do so, it was very useful the research performed in task 3 (\textit{Research and Documentation}, subsection \ref{sssec:researchTask}), which also provided information about some finished similar projects. The code and the usage of these tools helped to structurize and select which persistence techniques were going to be automated. 

This work lasted a week, and this task's conclusions were essential when working on the design task.
