\textbf{Explanation}

Once finished all the other tasks, \the\value{tCincHours} more hours were needed in order to finish writing and check the spelling and coherence in the final document.

Even though reporting is a long task, since most of the documentation was created in the previous tasks, this one required only a few extra days to add what was missing and polish it.

Finally, as this document is delivered a week before the defense, some more hours will be needed to prepare its presentation, which is explained in task 6 - \textit{Final presentation} (subsection \ref{sssec:finalPresentationTask}).
