\textbf{Explanation}

Before starting a TFG,
% (Bachelor's degree final project)
 it is necessary to do a viability study to be sure that the project fulfills the TFG's following requirements: it is possible to do with current technology, its scope is limited, it will help a community (research or open source communities, etc.), and that it can be finished in a few months.

In this case, this project viability was proven using the following arguments:
\begin{itemize}
%\item This project was listed as a TFM (Master's degree final project) proposal, so it is of interest to the cybersecurity community. Also, as explained in section \ref{sec:context} - \textit{Context}, it can have a direct impact on cybersecurity professionals.
\item As explained in section \ref{sec:context} - \textit{Context}, this project can have a direct impact on cybersecurity professionals, which makes it of interest to the cybersecurity community.
\item An adequate scope has been defined for the stipulated hours of dedication to the project, according to the standard hours per ECTS credit. 
%This scope was established with Eduardo Arriols, as he has lots of experience in this field, and was able to approximately estimate how much time each task will consume. 
\item When discussing the technology that the developed software would need, the conclusion was that the most recommended language to develop it with was Python for Linux, and PowerShell for Windows (both are widely used programming languages). And as they do not require any special hardware or software, the project can be done with just standard technology.
\end{itemize}

This duty was done in only \the\value{tUnHours} hours counting the time spent doing the initial research and all the meetings with the TFG director. So, in just a few days, this viability study was finished with a positive result.
