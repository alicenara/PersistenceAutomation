\subsection{Alternatives and action plan}
\label{ssec:alternativesSchedule}
When dealing with a big project like this one, it is common that the initially scheduled time does not adapt perfectly to the final spent time.

In this case, the research section was the most difficult to estimate as information on this topic is extensive and sometimes hard to limit due to it being scarce and outdated compared to other adversary tactics. For this reason, some extra hours were assigned to this task to prevent the schedule to be modified and, after finishing it, these extra hours proved to be useful.

Since the other tasks were more concise and atomic, no other delays were produced. That has been beneficial because all of this project's tasks were essential, so none of them could be dispensed of in the event of lacking time.

Also, some extra days were left in the end as can be seen in the Gantt project (section \ref{ssec:gantt}), just to be prepared in case of an unexpected small delay.
