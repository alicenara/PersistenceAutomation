\subsection{Task description}
\label{ssec:tasks}
In the sections below there is a description of each of this project's tasks. The \textit{Main Development} task is also divided into several subtasks due to its complexity.\\
For each task, there is a summary of the assigned hours, the hours of work per day (and the equivalent weeks of work), and an explanation of each task's goals (and its subtasks, if it applies). These estimations are done assuming that each week has five working days, and work has been done in 3 to 8 hours per day, even though there have been some weeks without progress due to holidays or other commitments.

While developing the project there were some control meetings with the project's director as well, which had a total duration of 5 hours: one after finishing the project management task in section \ref{sssec:projectManagementTask}, one after the fifth subtask of section \ref{sssec:mainDevTask} and the final was after finishing the last task in section \ref{sssec:finalTask}, to recapitulate. 

Finally, the last task in the Gantt chart, named "Final presentation", is bureaucratic time regarding the defense of the TFG, as the document needs to be delivered a week before the final presentation.
