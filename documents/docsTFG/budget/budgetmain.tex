\section{Budget evaluation}
\label{sec:budget}
To have an accurate approximation of the required budget to build this project, it is necessary to identify and evaluate its costs: there are different types of resources that have an associated cost, in addition to all the possible unexpected costs that could modify the final budget.

The development time calculated was of \the\value{totalFinalHours} hours, as concluded on section \ref{ssec:tasksAndResources}, so this economic analysis uses this value to calculate most of the costs.

In the end, a small percent (a 10\%) has been added to the final budget to cope with possible and unforeseen deviations (contingency plan).
